«The Bus»

The wheels on the bus go round and round
Round and round, round and round
The wheels on the bus go round and round
All through the town.

The people on the bus go up and down.
Up and down, up and down.
The people on the bus go up and down,
All through the town.

The baby on the bus cries, "Wah, wah, wah!"
Wah, wah, wah! Wah, wah, wah!"
The baby on the bus cries, "Wah, wah, wah!"
All through the town.

The mother on the bus goes, "Shhh, shhh, shhh!"
Shhh, shhh, shhh! Shhh, shhh, shhh!"
The mother on the bus goes, "Shhh, shhh, shhh!"
All through the town.
